/**
 * Credentials that bear the fully resolved and authenticated Principal, or an
 * indication that there is no such Principal. These Credentials are a mechanism
 * to pass into CAS information about an authentication and Principal resolution
 * that has already happened in layers in front of CAS, e.g. by means of a Java
 * Servlet Filter or by means of container authentication in the servlet
 * container or Apache layers. DO NOT accept these Credentials from arbitrary
 * web-servicey calls to CAS. Rather, the code constructing these Credentials
 * must be trusted to perform appropriate authentication before issuing these
 * credentials.
